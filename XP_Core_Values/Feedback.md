# XP Core Value

## Feedback
This core value was held by Animesh. Held responsible for maintaining the continuous feedback loop as it was essential for relentless improvement, We reduced the time for each item that is dependent on another item to travel through the system. We also avoided problems caused by task switching and reduced the need to constantly reprioritize items.

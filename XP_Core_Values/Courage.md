# XP Core Value

## Courage
I observed Courage as XP core value. Held responsible for taking realistic approach to complete the application. I made sure that Backend API code, WEB UI and Database should be designed in a manner that it would be easier for every team member to understand that. All of us developed our part as an individual entity and then we have integrated it in a continuous application.

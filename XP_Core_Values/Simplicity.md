# XP Core Value

## Simplicity
This core value was held by Wei. Held responsible for maintaining the workflow of everyone in our team. Been responsible for 
keeping the design of the system as simple as possible so that it is easier to maintain, support, and revise. We decided to only allow admin to open or close account for users, as the qualification process could be very complex and we don't have detail requirement. And we only allow one customer to have one account for each type, to keep it easier to implement, etc.

# XP Core Value

## Communication

For this XP core value, I was responsible for helping the team stay on task and focused during meetings. It was my priority to help the members in my team find the tools and resources in order for them to do the best job possible. This also also meant interpersonal communication was a high priority, as often our peers are the best source of mentorship and guidance available to us. Helping the team go from storming to performing was thus one of my biggest goals.
